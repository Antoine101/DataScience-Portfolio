# Dataquest Projects

This repository contains all the guided data science projects I have completed as part of my Dataquest "Data Scientist Career Path" training.

Please bear in mind that these projects were completed at different steps of my training and that they reflect the level of knowledge at a certain time.

Below is a list of all the projects in this repository with information on what step and course of the training they were part of.

## Profitable App Profiles for the Apple Store and Google Play Store Markets

Step 1 of 8 : Python Introduction

Course : Python for Data Science - Fundamentals

For this project, we pretend we're working as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and the App Store.
We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better.

In this project, we analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

## Exploring Hacker News Posts

Step 1 of 8 : Python Introduction

Course : Python for Data Science - Intermediate

In this project, we work with a data set of submissions to the popular technology site Hacker News and we determine what the best time to publish a post is in order to receive the most comments.

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

## Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data

Step 2 of 8 : Data Analysis and Visualization

Course : Pandas and Numpy Fundamentals

In this project, we work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a section of the German eBay website.
We clean the data and analyze the included used car listings to gain some insight on the second-hand cars market (most represented brands, prices distribution, average mileage, ...).

## Visualizing College Majors Population, Popularity and Median Earning

Step 2 of 8 : Data Analysis and Visualization

Course : Exploratory Data Visualization

In this project, we work with a dataset listing the job outcomes of students who graduated from college in the US between 2010 and 2012.

Using visualizations, we answer the following questions:

- Do students in more popular majors make more money?

- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?

- Which category of majors have the most students?

## Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys

Step 2 of 8 : Data Analysis and Visualization

Course : Data Cleaning and Analysis

In this project, we work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

We play the role of data analyst and answer the following questions to provide valuable insight to our stakeholders:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? 

- What about employees who have been there longer?

- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

## Analyzing NYC High School Data

Step 2 of 8 : Data Analysis and Visualization

Course : Data Cleaning Project Walkthrough

One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests like the SAT, and whether they're unfair to certain groups.

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.

In this project, we investigate the correlations between SAT scores and demographics and search for trends that would confirm the unfairness of such a test.
